/Name TBD/: An 8-bit hardware synthesizer
=========================================

The goal of this project is to create an 8-bit hardware synth.  This is still in
the very early stages, and there are a great many design decisions that have
not yet been made.  It also needs a name.

Building
--------

A hardware platform hasn't been chosen yet, so there is currently no release
build system.

Testing
-------

Unit tests are run with Ceedling.  To run the tests, install Ceedling 0.28.3 or
later.  Then, simply `cd` into this directory and run `ceedling`.  More
information about Ceedling and the underlying utilities and frameworks can be
found at [throwtheswitch.org](https://www.throwtheswitch.org/ceedling).
